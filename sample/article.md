# Introduction

This template helps you to create a properly formatted LaTeX2e manuscript.
Prepare your paper in the same style as used in this sample .pdf file.
Try to avoid excessive use of italics and bold face; underlining is generally banned (except for exceptional cases). Please do not use any LaTeX2e or TeX commands that affect the layout or formatting of your document (i.e., commands like `\textheight`, `\textwidth`, etc.). Note that the Introduction should be @s1 it should not immediately follow the abstract without a heading.

# Section headings

Here are some subsections:

## A subsection

Regular text.

### A subsubsection

Regular text.

**Paragraph heading**
If you want to add mini-headings for paragraphs without numbers please use `\paragraph*{}`.

# Text

## Lists

The following is an example of an *itemized* list,
two levels deep.

- This is the first item of an itemized list. Each item in the list is marked with a "tick." The document style determines what kind of tick mark is used.
- This is the second item of the list. It contains another list nested inside of it.
  - This is the first item of an itemized list that is nested within the itemized list.
  - This is the second item of the inner list. LaTeX allows you to nest lists deeper than you really should.

  This is the rest of the second item of the outer list.
- This is the third item of the list.

The following is an example of an *enumerated* list, two levels deep.

1. This is the first item of an enumerated list. Each item in the list is marked with a "tick." The document style determines what kind of tick mark is used.
2. This is the second item of the list. It contains another list nested inside of it.
   1. This is the first item of an enumerated list that is nested within.
   2. This is the second item of the inner list. LaTeX allows you to nest lists deeper than you really should.

   This is the rest of the second item of the outer list.
3. This is the third item of the list.

Do not use (1), (2), etc.  for items in order to avoid confusion with numbered equations.

## Punctuation

Avoid unnecessary hyphenation; many hyphenated words can be treated as one or two words.
Dashes come in three sizes: a hyphen, an intra-word dash like "$U$-statistics" or "the time-homogeneous model";
a medium dash (also called an "en-dash") for number ranges or between two equal entities like "1--2" or "Cauchy--Schwarz inequality";
and a punctuation dash (also called an "em-dash") in place of a comma, semicolon,
colon or parentheses---like this.

Generating an ellipsis $\ldots$ with the right spacing
around the periods requires using `\ldots`.

*Theoretical Economics* is using longer spaces after periods, please add `\` after periods that are not at the end of a sentence, in order to have regular spaces. For example, if there is an abbreviation (e.g., econ. theory) which is not the end of an article but appears in a middle of a sentence, please code it as `(e.g., econ.\ theory)`.

## Citation

Only include in the reference list entries for which there are text citations,
and make sure all citations are included in the reference list.
Simple author and year cite: {cite:t}`b1`.
Multiple bibliography items cite: {cite:t}`b2,b3,b4,b5`.
Parenthetical cite: {cite:p}`b1`.
Multiple narrative cites: {cite:t}`b2,b3,b4`.

Econometrica asks that papers with five or more authors be cited using the
initials of the first four authors followed by a plus sign, which the class
renders from the bibliography entry rather than from the citation: {cite:t}`b6`.

If your paper has an approved supplement, reference it at the end of the
introduction and cite it, for example "the Supplemental Appendix
({cite:t}`b5`) contains results for empirical tests". When referring to
material inside the supplement, use plain text rather than a cross-reference,
since the supplement is a separate document.

# Fonts

Please use text fonts in text mode, e.g.:

- Regular text `\textrm{}`
- *Italic* `\textit{}`
- **Bold** `\textbf{}`
- Small Caps `\textsc{}`
- Sans serif `\textsf{}`
- `Typewriter` `\texttt{}`

Please use mathematical fonts in mathematical mode, e.g.:

- $\mathrm{ABCabc123}$ `\mathrm{}`
- $\mathit{ABCabc123}$ `\mathit{}`
- $\mathbf{ABCabc123}$ `\mathbf{}`
- $\boldsymbol{ABCabc123\alpha\beta\gamma}$ `\boldsymbol{}`
- $\mathcal{ABC}$ `\mathcal{}`
- $\mathbb{ABC}$ `\mathbb{}`
- $\mathsf{ABCabc123}$ `\mathsf{}`
- $\mathtt{ABCabc123}$ `\mathtt{}`
- $\mathfrak{ABCabc123}$ `\mathfrak{}`

Note that `\mathcal, \mathbb` belongs to capital letters-only font typefaces.

# Notes

Footnotes[^1]
pose no problems in text.[^2] Please do not add footnotes on math.

[^1]: This is an example of a footnote.
[^2]: Note that footnote number is after punctuation.

# Numbers

A decimal point always should be preceded by a whole number and never should be left "naked." Decimal expressions of numbers less than 1 always should be preceded by a zero (0) to enhance the visibility of the decimal. For example, .3 should be 0.3. This applies to text, tables, and figures.

# Quotations

Text is displayed by indenting it from the left margin. There are short quotations

> This is a short quotation. It consists of a
> single paragraph of text. There is no paragraph
> indentation. It should be coded between `\begin{quote}` and `\end{quote}`.

and longer ones.

> This is a longer quotation. It consists of two paragraphs
> of text. The beginning of each paragraph is indicated
> by an extra indentation.
>
> This is the second paragraph of the quotation. It is just
> as dull as the first paragraph. It should be coded between `\begin{quotation}` and `\end{quotation}`.

# Environments

Please use regular counters (Theorem 1) as opposed to counters belonging on sections (Theorem 3.1). Results (Lemmas, Propositions, Theorems, Claims) can be on the same or different counters.

## Examples for *`plain`*-style environments

:::{prf:theorem}
:label: th1
This is the body of @th1.
:::

:::{prf:proof}
This is the body of the proof of the theorem above.
:::

:::{prf:proposition}
:label: cl1
This is the body of @cl1.
:::

:::{prf:axiom}
:label: ax1
This is the body of @ax1. Axioms should be on a different counter from results (e.g. Theorems, Propositions, Lemmas).
:::

:::{prf:theorem} Title of the Theorem
:label: th2
This is the body of @th2. @th2 has additional title.
:::

:::{prf:lemma}
:label: le1
This is the body of @le1. @le1 is numbered after
@th2 because we used `[theorem]` in `\newtheorem`.
:::

:::{prf:observation}
This is the body of the fact. Fact is unnumbered because we used the command `\newtheorem*`
instead of `\newtheorem`.
:::

:::{prf:proof} Proof of Theorem 2
This is the body of the proof of @th2.
:::


## Assumptions and algorithms

:::{prf:assumption}
:label: as1
Assumptions use `{prf:assumption}` and carry their own counter.
:::

Write the steps of an algorithm as an ordinary Markdown list when the paper is
also published as a website. It numbers correctly in both outputs, and nothing
is lost on either side.

:::{prf:algorithm}
:label: alg1
Endogenous grid method.

1. Initialize the exogenous grid.
2. For $t = T-1$ down to $0$:
   1. Invert the Euler equation.
   2. Recover the endogenous grid.
3. Return the policy function.
:::

For pseudocode typography (line numbers in a gutter, `for ... do` keywords), nest
an `algorithmic` block instead. It renders in both outputs, keeping the loop
structure on the website as well; only the `\Return` keyword is dropped there,
and its argument text survives:

:::{prf:algorithm}
:label: alg2
The same method as @alg1, typeset as pseudocode.

```{raw} latex
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State initialize the exogenous grid
\For{$t = T-1$ down to $0$}
  \State invert the Euler equation
  \State recover the endogenous grid
\EndFor
\State \Return the policy function
\end{algorithmic}
```
:::

## Examples for *`definition`*-style environments

The following environments can be numbered or not; if numbered, they should be on different counters from results.

:::{prf:definition}
:label: de1
This is the body of @de1. Definitions should be on a different counter from results (e.g. Theorems, Propositions, Lemmas).
:::

:::{prf:example}
This is the body of the example. Example is unnumbered because we used `\newtheorem*`
instead of `\newtheorem`.
:::

:::{prf:remark}
This is the body of the remark.
:::


# Equations and the like

Only number equations to which there is a subsequent reference.
See equations below {eq}`ccs`--{eq}`e7`. Please punctuate equations as you would punctuate a sentence, that is add a comma between two equations and add a period if it ends a sentence.

Two equations:

```math
C_{s}  =  K_{M} \frac{\mu/\mu_{x}}{1-\mu/\mu_{x}}
\label{ccs}
```

and

```math
G = \frac{P_{\mathrm{opt}} - P_{\mathrm{ref}}}{P_{\mathrm{ref}}}  100(\%).
```

Equation arrays:

```math
\begin{align}
  \frac{dS}{dt} & = - \sigma X + s_{F} F,\\
  \frac{dX}{dt} & =   \mu    X,\\
  \frac{dP}{dt} & =   \pi    X - k_{h} P,\\
  \frac{dV}{dt} & =   F.
\end{align}
```

One long equation, note that the equation number is on the last line:

```{math}
:label: e7
\begin{aligned}
 \mu_{\text{normal}} & = \mu_{x} \frac{C_{s}}{K_{x}C_{x}+C_{s}} \\
                     & = \mu_{\text{normal}} - Y_{x/s}\bigl(1-H(C_{s})\bigr)(m_{s}+\pi /Y_{p/s})\\
                     & = \mu_{\text{normal}}/Y_{x/s}+ H(C_{s}) (m_{s}+ \pi /Y_{p/s}).
\end{aligned}
```

Note that variables made of more than one letter should use command `\mathit`,
e.g., $\mathit{sov}=550$, where $\mathit{sov}$ is sum of votes. Abbreviations used in subscripts or superscripts should use `\mathrm`,
e.g., $t_{\mathrm{max}}-t_{\mathrm{min}} =10$. Operator names should use `\operatorname`, e.g. $\operatorname{AR}(1)$. Also, note that $\emptyset$ symbol is preferred to $\varnothing$.

# Tables and figures

Cross-references to labeled tables: As you can see in {numref}`sphericcase`
and also in {numref}`parset`.

Sample of cross-reference to figure: {numref}`penG` shows that it is not easy to get something on paper. Note that figures will be in grayscale in the printed version.

% The appendix is opened and closed with raw LaTeX and its content is spliced in
% with `include`, rather than declared as a `parts.appendix` frontmatter entry.
% This is deliberate and is the supported form. Against this template a
% `parts: appendix:` entry loses the appendix ENTIRELY and silently, because the
% template has no branch for it; the underlying MyST behavior is that harvesting
% walks the rendered document and frontmatter parts are excluded from it, so such
% an appendix would also lose any reference it alone cites. Content spliced
% into the body is in the main AST and its citations survive. The raw blocks are
% NOT invisible in HTML: MyST parses each one and renders the environment name as
% a paragraph, so the website shows a stray paragraph reading "appendix" at each
% end of the appendix. The PDF is correct; that is the cost on the web side.
% Headings in `appendix.md` must be `#` level: included content sits one level
% below the surrounding sections, and a demoted heading does not pick up the
% class's appendix prefix, printing ".1" instead of "APPENDIX A:".
