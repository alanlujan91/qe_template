#
# Build every sample export and verify the PDFs are real, current, and typeset
# with the right journal's bibliography style.
#
# This exists because `myst build` exits 0 on a broken build, so a hook that
# checks only its exit status reports success on a document that failed to
# typeset. Reading the exit code is not enough; neither, it turns out, is
# reading the logs.
#
# Three things had to be measured rather than assumed, and each one changed the
# design:
#
#   1. A MISSING or unreadable .bst produces no error anywhere. myst exits 0,
#      the LaTeX logs stay clean, and no .blg survives to grep, because the
#      failure is BibTeX's rather than LaTeX's. The PDF is produced with its
#      bibliography silently absent. Only the artifact shows it.
#   2. A WRONG but valid .bst is invisible to that check. Feeding Econometrica's
#      econsoc.bst to a Theoretical Economics document yields a fully populated
#      bibliography, a clean log, a normal-size PDF, and every content assertion
#      passing, while the document is typeset in the wrong journal's style. That
#      is the exact failure this template's per-journal selection exists to
#      prevent, so the emitted \bibliographystyle is checked against what the
#      journal's own upstream template prescribes.
#   3. Validating whatever PDFs happen to be on disk is not the same as
#      validating this build's output. With no TeX toolchain installed, myst
#      still exits 0, produces nothing, and the previously committed PDFs sit
#      there satisfying every assertion. So the export directory is cleared
#      first and the expected count asserted.
#
# Building both sources covers all three journals, since each source carries one
# export per journal. Econometrica and Theoretical Economics are compiled here
# and nowhere else: CI has no TeX toolchain by design.
